 * NOTE: This is a stage background debugging facility that provides FPS-like keyboard-and-mouse
 * fly-mode camera control. This code is not linked into non-developer builds, and usually is not
 * referenced anywhere â€” it is expected to be used transiently while working on backgrounds.
 *
 * To use it, simply call `camcontrol_init` in your background animation setup code instead of
 * invoking normal animation code. For best results, disable anything that can alter the camera
 * state directly. Or you can allocate a secondary camera for this purpose.
 *
 * See camcontrol.c for controls and adjustable parameters.
