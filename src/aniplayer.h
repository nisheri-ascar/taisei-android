// In principle, playing an animation does not require any state, just a call to
// get_animation_frame will get you the right sprite out of a sequence. But if
// you want easy queueing and seamless switching between animation sequences,
// you can use an AniPlayer.
//
// It works like this: AniPlayer contains a queue where you can enqueue
// animation sequences using aniplayer_queue. Then the player will count as many
// loops/frames as you specified and once done, go to the next queue entry. If
// there is no other queue entry, the current entry is looped until something is
// added. Then the queue will switch at the next sequence endpoint for seamlessness.
//
// For aniplayer_queue takes a number of minimum loops that should be played
// before the animation is switched (remember it goes on forever if there is
// nothing to follow). For convenience there is also aniplayer_queue_frames
// which allows you to specify a minimum number of frames.
//
// If you need to go to a new sequence asap but still in a seamless way you can use
// aniplayer_soft_switch to forget about the queue and do your sequence directly
// after the currently running one.
//
// If that is still not okay for you (You just need to switch instantly, I
// respect that) you can call aniplayer_hard_switch to switch to a new sequence
// directly. This wonâ€™t be seamless though. Seamlessness is the biggest quirk of
// this api because it typically delays things and you need to queue early
// enough to get the queue transition at the right time.
//
// Examples:
//
// 1. make Hina spin one loop
//
// 	aniplayer_queue(&h->ani, "guruguru", 1);
// 	aniplayer_queue(&h->ani, "main", 0);
//
// The second line is important. Giving 0 minloops as an argument is common.
// It just means that the animation should not play longer than need be.
// In fact, having a call with minloops != 0 not followed by another call does
// not make much sense. If you want to play n-loops you need to provide
// something to switch to.
//
// 2. make Cirno flex for 30 frames
//
// 	aniplayer_queue_frames(&c->ani, "(9)", 30);
// 	aniplayer_queue(&c->ani, "main", 0);
//
// Same story. This flavor is also useful in some spells.
//
// 3. make Cirno flex for the whole spell
//
//	aniplayer_queue(&c->ani, "(9)", 0);
//
// 4. make the player react to an input instantly
//
//	aniplayer_hard_switch(&plr->ani, "right", 0);
//
// Similar examples occur throughout the code so if you want context, you can just look there.
